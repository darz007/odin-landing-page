- This was a fun little project that took me a little over an hour to complete
- Although I can movile optimise this, add hover effects etc, I decided not to as I wanted to stick to the course material and also to move on to the next section as I won't learn anything further adding those things due to being well versed in it already. 
- I am going to admit, this is some pretty sloppy code on my behalf and I definetly could have approached this a bit better. my over-use of containers and wrappers was not necessary.
